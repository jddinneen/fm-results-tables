# Intro

This folder contains the tabular results, CDF plots, and R scripts produced during a study of file-size distributions among users' desktop and laptop computers running Mac OS, Windows, and GNU/Linux (Dinneen & Nguyen, 2021). Please see the manuscript for more details.

## Content guide

- The CSV files (1-3) show the tabular results; 1 is a guide to the sample size and breakdown of participant groups, 2 provides normal descriptive statistics, and 3 provides log-normal descriptive statistics.
- The png files are cumulative distribution frequency (CDF) plots of the files from each operating system, from each collection use, and for knowledge workers across multiple studies.
- R scripts are provided for convenience (e.g. to perform similar analyses or replicate the study).
